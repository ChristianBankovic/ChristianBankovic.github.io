So, I want this code to:
 ~ Ask for the difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard
 ~ Generate two random numbers between 0 and 10, 0 and 100, and 0 and 1000 for their respective difficulties.
 ~ Multiply them together to get the total value.
 ~ Display the text of "a * b = ?"
 ~ Prompt the user for an answer.
 ~ If the answer is wrong, flash red and say it is wrong.
 ~ If the answer is wrong 3 times, show the correct answer and move on to the next question.
 ~ If the answer is correct, flash green and say it is correct, then move on to the next question.
 ~ Show the score of wrong and correct answers.
 ~ To move onto the next question, start again at bullet #2.
