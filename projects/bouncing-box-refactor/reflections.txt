 ~ How is the jQuery file being loaded into this project: direct download or Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
I think it's a Content Dlivery Network, because the link being used to load the jQuery is a link.

 ~ If you load the index.js file before the jquery file our program doesn't work. Why? Open the preview in a new tab and look at the console to help you find out why.
I've noticed in the past that when using jQuery, it does matter what order the code is in. I believe the program doesn't work if index.js is loaded before the jQuery because when index.js runs, it can't run properly because it jQuery hasn't loaded yet. I mean, that's basically the obvious, but it's what's happening.

 ~ In your opinion, what are the pros of refactoring your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files? What are the cons?
Pros are being able to easily identify which parts of my code are for what, and being able to indentify better where errors are. A con might be that it takes some time to do. But, it's worth it in the long run!

 ~ In your opinion, what are the pros of refactoring your JavaScript code into separate functions? What are the cons?
The pros of this are being able to understand your code better, and navigate it easier. A con, again, is that it may take some time to refactor it.
